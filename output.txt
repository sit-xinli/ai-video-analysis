Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

Scene Description: このシーンでは、車椅子を使っている人がさまざまな障害物を安全に越える方法について説明しています。最初に、速度バンプのような障害物に近づくときは、衝撃で車椅子から落ちる危険があるため、代わりのルートを探すことを勧めています。次に、障害物を管理するために補助者と協力することや、小さな障害物（例：ホース）を越える練習方法についても触れています。大きな段差や凹凸のある道では、バランスを取りながら車輪を持ち上げる方法や、前に体を傾けて勢いをつけて越えることが重要です。最後に、障害物を越えた後、車椅子が倒れないように注意することも述べられています。
